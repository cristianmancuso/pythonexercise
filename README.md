#Exercise in Python:

### 1. Morse Code
A keyword cipher is a monoalphabetic cipher which uses a "keyword" to provide encryption. It is somewhat similar to a Caesar cipher.In a keyword cipher, repeats of letters in the keyword are removed and the alphabet is reordered such that the letters in the keyword appear first, followed by the rest of the letters in the alphabet in their otherwise usual order.
E.g. for an uppercase latin alphabet with keyword of "KEYWORD":
A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z
becomes:
K|E|Y|W|O|R|D|A|B|C|F|G|H|I|J|L|M|N|P|Q|S|T|U|V|X|Z

### 4.Sms cut:
SMS messages have a limitation of 160 characters. This means that you cannot send text messages that exceed 160 characters at once. If you do, the message might be truncated or split into multiple messages.Sometimes, when you write a text message, you may realize that you have exceeded the 160-character limit by just a few additional characters. This can be frustrating, especially if you don't want to edit the entire message.The task is to reduce the message to 160 characters, starting from the end of the message. To do this, you are asked to replace spaces with camelCase. This means that you should remove the spaces and change the first letter of each word that follows a space to uppercase.You continue doing this until the message is exactly 160 characters in length or less.If after making all these changes the message is still longer than 160 characters, you should simply return the resulting message without truncating or splitting it into multiple messages.

### 5.Text Change

### 6.Change you in the messega
Your friend won't stop texting his girlfriend. It's all he does. All day. Seriously. The texts are so mushy too! The whole situation just makes you feel ill. Being the wonderful friend that you are, you hatch an evil plot. While he's sleeping, you take his phone and change the autocorrect options so that every time he types "you" or "u" it gets changed to "your sister."
Write a function called autocorrect that takes a string and replaces all instances of "you" or "u" (not case sensitive) with "your sister" (always lower case).
